# java_raptor_portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of works to demonstrate my capabilities to write code and work with Raptor, a flowchart interpreter, and the java that goes with it.

These examples are from small projects completed in 2010.

** This is not javascript code, just java, hence the use of Raptor to compile the code. **
